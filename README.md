# üß≠ Lodestone Waystones
A minimalist and immersive waypoint system for Survival Minecraft, using Lodestones and compasses. **A new way to know your way!**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Players can create waypoints by following these simple steps:

**1.** Place a Lodestone.

**2.** Link a compass to it.

**3.** Drop the compass on top of the Lodestone to activate the Waystone.

This creates a new waypoint on your Locator Bar, helping you navigate your world.

### üí´ Tips:

- **Add a carpet on top of the Lodestone** before throwing the compass to create a **colored Waystone icon**. Supports all 16 different colors.

- **Waystone icons are customized** to differentiate them from player icons in the Locator Bar.
- The **farther** you are from the Waystone, the **smaller** the icon becomes!
- **Breaking the Lodestone** or **punching the compass** will remove the Waystone.
- **This Data Pack supports multiplayer.**
